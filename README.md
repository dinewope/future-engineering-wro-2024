 Team kick-off meeting
 
Аfter reading the game manual and watching videos on YouTube about the future engineers competition, our team gathered to discuss the robot prototype and divide duties among ourselves. When the discussion began, Alimzhan offered to take on the role of team coder due to his extensive experience coding in other competitions like FLL and VEX V5. I agreed, and Alimzhan became our coder. With coding responsibilities settled, the tasks of writing the documentation notebook and building the robot remained.
Given my experience building robots with VEX V5, I proposed to Alimzhan that I could handle the building aspect. Alimzhan agreed, and I took on the role of builder. This left only the task of writing the notebook, which we decided to split between us. Alimzhan would handle the coding-related sections, while I would take care of the building-related sections.
 
With our roles defind, we began discussing our robot prototype. Alimzhan initially suggested building the robot using Arduino, but we realized we lacked the necessary Arduino kit, and acquiring one could be problematic. Additionally, none of us were familiar with building on Arduino, so I suggested that it wouldn't be feasible for us. Therefore, we decided to brainstorm other options for our robot prototype.
After some deliberation, I proposed to Alimzhan that we build our robot using LEGO. We had a wide range of LEGO spare parts available at our school, and Alimzhan already had experience coding for LEGO robots using Scratch from his participation in FLL. Building with LEGO seemed like the best choice for us, given our resources and Alimzhan's expertise.
 
Then we begin deciding how our robot will work.it take a really long time because there were so many ideas given by each of us.But after determination advantages and disadvantages we understand how good or bad idea is.So,after some such discussion we choose best option.The best option for us, the best solution was to make the front wheels turn on the current and the rear wheels only go straight or backward.Because we can’t made front wheels as in cars on lego.All we can do is to make wheels turn to two side only or make them so they can go straight and backwards.Only one option could be taken for front wheels or rear wheels.So that why we decided that the front wheels turn on the current and the rear wheels only go straight or backward.
It was the best option because front wheels will because the front wheels will guide the robot to the right or left and the rear wheels will guide the robot in the appropriate direction
           Building rear wheels
 
I start to build the rear wheels because I already imagined how they would look. The only problem was the gear rotation. I didn't know whether I needed to increase force or speed. It would be better to increase force because, with low force, the two rear wheels cannot move the two front wheels and the entire robot. However, if I increased the force, the robot would be slow, and if I increased the speed, there would be a problem with the force .
 
I was considering this when Alimzhan proposed a solution: to design a gear rotation system that increases speed but ensures that the rear wheels have enough force to move the robot. I agreed with this idea and started building. After a while, I finally completed it and built the rear wheels as shown on the photos

 

 
           Building front wheels
 
After i built rear wheels i start to build front wheels.It was harder to build front wheels becase it was hard to come up with mechanism that will turn wheels to the left and right side.After long brainstorm and discussion we decided to make mechanism as on a photo

 
 

Connecting front and rear wheels
 
After i built front and rear wheels i start to connect them and     connect brain to them as it showed on a photo.
 

 

        Connecting all sensors to the robot
After I build and connect rear and front wheels i start connecting sensors.I connected two distance sensors,one colour sensor and EV3 minstorm sensor as it showed on the photos

 
 

       Remodeling rear wheels
When Alimzhan were testing a code he say that there is a problem in a robot.He said that rear wheels are located higher than front wheels so it interefere robot driving.Therefore,I change rear wheels as it showed on the photo
